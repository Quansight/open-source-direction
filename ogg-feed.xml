        <![CDATA[<p>GeoViews is a Python library that makes it easy to explore and visualize
geographical, meteorological, and oceanographic datasets, such as those
used in weather, climate, and remote sensing research. GeoViews is built
on the HoloViews library for building flexible visualizations of
multidimensional data. GeoViews adds a family of geographic plot
types based on the Cartopy library, plotted using either the
Matplotlib or Bokeh packages. With GeoViews, you can now work
easily and naturally with large, multidimensional geographic
datasets, instantly visualizing any subset or combination of them,
while always being able to access the raw data underlying any plot.

        <![CDATA[<p>XND is an extensible framework of C libraries and Python modules for
handling typed memory blocks. XND recreates the foundations of NumPy as a
number of smaller libraries, combining the lessons learned in the past twenty
years of array computing in Python with the needs of newer applications.
XND&#39;s type system is more general than NumPy&#39;s and allows unpacking
arbitrarily nested Python type hierarchies directly to memory.

XND&#39;s computational kernels are multimethods and can be generated
and inserted into modular lookup tables at runtime. This opens the
possibility for a large variety of applications written in different
languages to use XND as a container backend.

Ongoing work connects
XND to Numba, Lapack/MKL and the CUDA kernel libraries. There is
interest in integrating XND with a variety of libraries like Dask,
xarray, Numba, Chainer, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PyMC4, TVM/NNVM,
Plasma Store, Apache Arrow, and Tensor Comprehensions.

        <![CDATA[<p>NOTE: Please forgive the technical difficulties we had in recording this episode.
Carlos had some connectivity issues. We are releasing this episode because we
still want to bring you all of the news about Spyder!

Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It offers a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.

Beyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further via its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing developers to build upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive console, in their own PyQt software.
