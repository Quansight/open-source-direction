        <![CDATA[<p>Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction
technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for
general non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm is founded on three assumptions
about the data:

1. The data is uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold;
2. The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such);
3. The manifold is locally connected.

From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy topological
structure. The embedding is found by searching for a low dimensional projection
of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure.

        <![CDATA[<p>XND is an extensible framework of C libraries and Python modules for
handling typed memory blocks. XND recreates the foundations of NumPy as a
number of smaller libraries, combining the lessons learned in the past twenty
years of array computing in Python with the needs of newer applications.
XND&#39;s type system is more general than NumPy&#39;s and allows unpacking
arbitrarily nested Python type hierarchies directly to memory.

XND&#39;s computational kernels are multimethods and can be generated
and inserted into modular lookup tables at runtime. This opens the
possibility for a large variety of applications written in different
languages to use XND as a container backend.

Ongoing work connects
XND to Numba, Lapack/MKL and the CUDA kernel libraries. There is
interest in integrating XND with a variety of libraries like Dask,
xarray, Numba, Chainer, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PyMC4, TVM/NNVM,
Plasma Store, Apache Arrow, and Tensor Comprehensions.

arbitrarily nested Python type hierarchies directly to memory.

XND&#39;s computational kernels are multimethods and can be generated
and inserted into modular lookup tables at runtime. This opens the
possibility for a large variety of applications written in different
languages to use XND as a container backend.

Ongoing work connects
XND to Numba, Lapack/MKL and the CUDA kernel libraries. There is
interest in integrating XND with a variety of libraries like Dask,
xarray, Numba, Chainer, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PyMC4, TVM/NNVM,
Plasma Store, Apache Arrow, and Tensor Comprehensions.

Carlos had some connectivity issues. We are releasing this episode because we
still want to bring you all of the news about Spyder!

Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It offers a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.

Beyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further via its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing developers to build upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive console, in their own PyQt software.
