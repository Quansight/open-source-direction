    Voilà turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications.

    Unlike the usual HTML-converted notebooks, each user connecting to the Voilà tornado
    application gets a dedicated Jupyter kernel which can execute the callbacks to changes
    in Jupyter interactive widgets.

    By default, Voilà disallows execute requests from the front-end, preventing execution
    of arbitrary code. By default, Voilà runs with the strip_source option, which strips out
    the input cells from the rendered notebook.
