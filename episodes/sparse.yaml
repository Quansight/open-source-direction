description: "The aim of PyData/Sparse is to create sparse containers that implement\
  \ the ndarray interface. Traditionally in the PyData ecosystem, sparse arrays have\
  \ been provided by the scipy.sparse submodule. All containers there depend on and\
  \ emulate the numpy.matrix interface. This means that they are limited to two dimensions\
  \ and also do not work well in places where numpy.ndarray would work.\n\nPyData/Sparse\
  \ is well on its way to replacing scipy.sparse as the de-facto sparse array implementation\
  \ in the PyData ecosystem.\n"
