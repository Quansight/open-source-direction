description: "Panel provides tools for easily composing widgets, plots, tables,\n\
  and other viewable objects and controls into control panels, apps,\nand dashboards.\
  \ Panel works with visualizations from Bokeh, Matplotlib,\nHoloViews, and other\
  \ Python plotting libraries, making them instantly\nviewable either individually\
  \ or when combined with interactive widgets\nthat control them. Panel works equally\
  \ well in Jupyter Notebooks,\nfor creating quick data-exploration tools, or as standalone\
  \ deployed\napps and dashboards, and allows you to easily switch between those\n\
  contexts as needed.\n"
