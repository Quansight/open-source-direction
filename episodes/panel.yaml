    Panel provides tools for easily composing widgets, plots, tables,
    and other viewable objects and controls into control panels, apps,
    and dashboards. Panel works with visualizations from Bokeh, Matplotlib,
    HoloViews, and other Python plotting libraries, making them instantly
    viewable either individually or when combined with interactive widgets
    that control them. Panel works equally well in Jupyter Notebooks,
    for creating quick data-exploration tools, or as standalone deployed
    apps and dashboards, and allows you to easily switch between those
    contexts as needed.
