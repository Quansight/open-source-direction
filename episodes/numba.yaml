description: |
    Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of
    Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. Numba translates
    Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the
    Industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical
    algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.
    Users do not need to replacethe Python interpreter, run a separate
    compilation step, or even have a C/C++ compiler installed. Applying
    one of the Numba decorators to a Python function is all that is needed.
