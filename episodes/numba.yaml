description: "Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of\nPython\
  \ and NumPy code into fast machine code. Numba translates\nPython functions to optimized\
  \ machine code at runtime using the\nIndustry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled\
  \ numerical\nalgorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.\nUsers\
  \ do not need to replacethe Python interpreter, run a separate\ncompilation step,\
  \ or even have a C/C++ compiler installed. Applying\none of the Numba decorators\
  \ to a Python function is all that is needed.\n"
