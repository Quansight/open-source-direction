    PyViz is a set of examples that help you see how various
    Python packages can work together to solve a huge range
    of visualization problems, from common situations to tricky
    special cases. Although there is an installable package named pyviz,
    itâ€™s valuable mainly for its dependencies, which are a coherent set
    of libraries designed to work well together. There is almost no code
    actually in PyViz, apart from the examples in the tutorials.
