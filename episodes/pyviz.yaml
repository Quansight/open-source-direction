description: "PyViz is a set of examples that help you see how various\nPython packages\
  \ can work together to solve a huge range\nof visualization problems, from common\
  \ situations to tricky\nspecial cases. Although there is an installable package\
  \ named pyviz,\nitâ€™s valuable mainly for its dependencies, which are a coherent\
  \ set\nof libraries designed to work well together. There is almost no code\nactually\
  \ in PyViz, apart from the examples in the tutorials."
