description: |
    The Econ-ARK project provides open-source toolkits for researchers
    trying to understand how economic and social outcomes result from
    the actions of heterogeneous individuals.

    The primary goals of the project are to make entry into the world
    of such modeling easy; to accelerate the development of this kind
    of modeling for policy-making and academic research; and to increase
    the openness, replicability, and interoperability of modeling tools.
