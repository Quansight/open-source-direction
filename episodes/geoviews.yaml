description: "GeoViews is a Python library that makes it easy to explore and visualize\n\
  geographical, meteorological, and oceanographic datasets, such as those\nused in\
  \ weather, climate, and remote sensing research. GeoViews is built\non the HoloViews\
  \ library for building flexible visualizations of\nmultidimensional data. GeoViews\
  \ adds a family of geographic plot\ntypes based on the Cartopy library, plotted\
  \ using either the\nMatplotlib or Bokeh packages. With GeoViews, you can now work\n\
  easily and naturally with large, multidimensional geographic\ndatasets, instantly\
  \ visualizing any subset or combination of them,\nwhile always being able to access\
  \ the raw data underlying any plot.\n"
