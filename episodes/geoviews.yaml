description: |
    GeoViews is a Python library that makes it easy to explore and visualize
    geographical, meteorological, and oceanographic datasets, such as those
    used in weather, climate, and remote sensing research. GeoViews is built
    on the HoloViews library for building flexible visualizations of
    multidimensional data. GeoViews adds a family of geographic plot
    types based on the Cartopy library, plotted using either the
    Matplotlib or Bokeh packages. With GeoViews, you can now work
    easily and naturally with large, multidimensional geographic
    datasets, instantly visualizing any subset or combination of them,
    while always being able to access the raw data underlying any plot.
