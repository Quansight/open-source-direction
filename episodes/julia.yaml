description: "In this episode of Open Source Directions we were joined by Jeff Bezanson\
  \ and Katie Hyatt who talk about the work they have been doing with Julia. Julia\
  \ is a programming language that was designed from the beginning for high performance.\
  \ It programs compile to native code for multiple platforms via LLVM. Julia is dynamically\
  \ typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.\n\
  \nJulia has a rich language of descriptive datatypes, and type declarations can\
  \ be used to clarify and solidify programs. This language uses multiple dispatch\
  \ as a paradigm, making it easy to express many object-oriented and functional programming\
  \ patterns. It provides asynchronous I/O, debugging, logging, profiling, a package\
  \ manager, and more.\n"
