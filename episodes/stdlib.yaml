description: |
    stdlib ("standard lib") is a standard library for JavaScript and Node.js, with an
    emphasis on numerical and scientific computing applications. The library provides
    a collection of robust, high performance libraries for mathematics, statistics,
    data processing, streams, and more and includes many of the utilities you would
    expect from a standard library.
