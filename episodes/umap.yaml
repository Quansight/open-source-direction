description: "Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension\
  \ reduction\ntechnique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but\
  \ also for\ngeneral non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm is founded on\
  \ three assumptions\nabout the data:\n\n1. The data is uniformly distributed on\
  \ a Riemannian manifold;\n2. The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be\
  \ approximated as such);\n3. The manifold is locally connected.\n\nFrom these assumptions\
  \ it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy topological\nstructure. The\
  \ embedding is found by searching for a low dimensional projection\nof the data\
  \ that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure.\n"
