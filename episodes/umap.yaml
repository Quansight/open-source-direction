    Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction
    technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for
    general non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm is founded on three assumptions
    about the data:

    1. The data is uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold;
    2. The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such);
    3. The manifold is locally connected.

    From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy topological
    structure. The embedding is found by searching for a low dimensional projection
    of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure.
