description: "xtensor provides an extensible expression system enabling lazy broadcasting,\
  \ an API following the idioms of the C++ standard library, and tools to manipulate\
  \ array expressions and build upon xtensor. xtensor containers are inspired by NumPy,\
  \ the Python array programming library. Adaptors for existing data structures to\
  \ be plugged into our expression system can easily be written.\n\nxtensor requires\
  \ a modern C++ compiler supporting C++14.\n"
