description: "Datashader is a graphics pipeline system for creating meaningful\nrepresentations\
  \ of large datasets quickly and flexibly. Datashader\nbreaks the creation of images\
  \ into a series of explicit steps that\nallow computations to be done on intermediate\
  \ representations.\nThis approach allows accurate and effective visualizations to\
  \ be\nproduced automatically without trial-and-error parameter tuning,\nand also\
  \ makes it simple for data scientists to focus on particular\ndata and relationships\
  \ of interest in a principled way."
