description: |
    Datashader is a graphics pipeline system for creating meaningful
    representations of large datasets quickly and flexibly. Datashader
    breaks the creation of images into a series of explicit steps that
    allow computations to be done on intermediate representations.
    This approach allows accurate and effective visualizations to be
    produced automatically without trial-and-error parameter tuning,
    and also makes it simple for data scientists to focus on particular
    data and relationships of interest in a principled way.
