description: "Chainer is a powerful, flexible and intuitive deep learning framework.\n\
  Chainer supports CUDA computation. It only requires a few lines of code to\nleverage\
  \ a GPU. It also runs on multiple GPUs with little effort.\nChainer supports various\
  \ network architectures including feed-forward nets,\nconvnets, recurrent nets and\
  \ recursive nets. It also supports per-batch\narchitectures. Forward computation\
  \ can include any control flow statements\nof Python without lacking the ability\
  \ of backpropagation. It makes code\nintuitive and easy to debug.\n"
