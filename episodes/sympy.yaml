    SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It
    aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system
    (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be
    comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.
    All purely symbolic mathematical computation is in scope for SymPy.
