description: "SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It\naims to become\
  \ a full-featured computer algebra system\n(CAS) while keeping the code as simple\
  \ as possible in order to be\ncomprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written\
  \ entirely in Python.\nAll purely symbolic mathematical computation is in scope\
  \ for SymPy.\n"
