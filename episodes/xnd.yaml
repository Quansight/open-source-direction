description: "XND is an extensible framework of C libraries and Python modules for\n\
  handling typed memory blocks. XND recreates the foundations of NumPy as a\nnumber\
  \ of smaller libraries, combining the lessons learned in the past twenty\nyears\
  \ of array computing in Python with the needs of newer applications.\nXND's type\
  \ system is more general than NumPy's and allows unpacking\narbitrarily nested Python\
  \ type hierarchies directly to memory.\n\nXND's computational kernels are multimethods\
  \ and can be generated\nand inserted into modular lookup tables at runtime. This\
  \ opens the\npossibility for a large variety of applications written in different\n\
  languages to use XND as a container backend.\n\nOngoing work connects\nXND to Numba,\
  \ Lapack/MKL and the CUDA kernel libraries. There is\ninterest in integrating XND\
  \ with a variety of libraries like Dask,\nxarray, Numba, Chainer, PyTorch, Tensorflow,\
  \ PyMC4, TVM/NNVM,\nPlasma Store, Apache Arrow, and Tensor Comprehensions.\n"
