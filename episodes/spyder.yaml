description: "NOTE: Please forgive the technical difficulties we had in recording\
  \ this episode.\nCarlos had some connectivity issues. We are releasing this episode\
  \ because we\nstill want to bring you all of the news about Spyder!\n\nSpyder is\
  \ a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed\
  \ by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It offers a unique combination\
  \ of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a\
  \ comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution,\
  \ deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.\n\
  \nBeyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further\
  \ via its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5\
  \ extension library, allowing developers to build upon its functionality and embed\
  \ its components, such as the interactive console, in their own PyQt software.\n"
