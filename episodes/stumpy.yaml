description: "STUMPY is a powerful and scalable library that efficiently computes\
  \ something called\nthe matrix profile, which can be used for a variety of\ntime\
  \ series data mining tasks such as: pattern/motif\n(approximately repeated subsequences\
  \ within a longer time series) discovery,\nanomaly/novelty (discord) discovery,\n\
  shapelet discovery,\nsemantic segmentation,\ndensity estimation,\ntime series chains\
  \ (temporally ordered set of subsequence patterns),\nand more!\n"
