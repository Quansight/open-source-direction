    STUMPY is a powerful and scalable library that efficiently computes something called
    the matrix profile, which can be used for a variety of
    time series data mining tasks such as: pattern/motif
    (approximately repeated subsequences within a longer time series) discovery,
    anomaly/novelty (discord) discovery,
    shapelet discovery,
    semantic segmentation,
    density estimation,
    time series chains (temporally ordered set of subsequence patterns),
    and more!
