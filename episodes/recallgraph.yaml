    In this episode of Open Source Directions we were joined by Aditya Mukhopadhyay who talked about the work he has been doing with RecallGraph. RecallGraph is a versioned-graph data store - it retains all changes that its data (vertices and edges) have gone through to reach their current state. It supports point-in-time graph traversals, letting the user query any past state of the graph just as easily as the present.
