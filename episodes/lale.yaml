description: "Lale is a Python library for semi-automated data science. Lale makes\
  \ it easy to\nautomatically select algorithms and tune hyperparameters of pipelines\
  \ that are\ncompatible with scikit-learn, in a type-safe fashion. If you are a data\
  \ scientist\nwho wants to experiment with automated machine learning, this library\
  \ is for you!\nLale adds value beyond scikit-learn along three dimensions: automation,\n\
  correctness checks, and interoperability. For automation, Lale provides\na consistent\
  \ high-level interface to existing pipeline search tools including\nGridSearchCV,\
  \ SMAC, and Hyperopt. For correctness checks, Lale uses JSON Schema\nto catch mistakes\
  \ when there is a mismatch between hyperparameters and their type,\nor between data\
  \ and operators. And for interoperability, Lale has a growing library\nof transformers\
  \ and estimators from popular libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost,\nPyTorch\
  \ etc. Lale can be installed just like any other Python package and can be\nedited\
  \ with off-the-shelf Python tools such as Jupyter notebooks.\n"
