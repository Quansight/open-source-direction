description: |
    Lale is a Python library for semi-automated data science. Lale makes it easy to
    automatically select algorithms and tune hyperparameters of pipelines that are
    compatible with scikit-learn, in a type-safe fashion. If you are a data scientist
    who wants to experiment with automated machine learning, this library is for you!
    Lale adds value beyond scikit-learn along three dimensions: automation,
    correctness checks, and interoperability. For automation, Lale provides
    a consistent high-level interface to existing pipeline search tools including
    GridSearchCV, SMAC, and Hyperopt. For correctness checks, Lale uses JSON Schema
    to catch mistakes when there is a mismatch between hyperparameters and their type,
    or between data and operators. And for interoperability, Lale has a growing library
    of transformers and estimators from popular libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost,
    PyTorch etc. Lale can be installed just like any other Python package and can be
    edited with off-the-shelf Python tools such as Jupyter notebooks.
